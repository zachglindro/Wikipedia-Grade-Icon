# Wikipedia Grade Icon

## Description

Wikipedia Grade Icon is a browser extension that displays the quality grade icon for English Wikipedia articles. The extension fetches the article's assessment class (A, B, C, Start, Stub, or List) from the Wikipedia API and displays the corresponding icon at the top of the article. This provides users with an immediate visual indication of the article's quality as assessed by Wikipedia editors.

The extension works on any English Wikipedia article page and displays icons for non-featured articles (excluding FA, GA, and FL classes).
